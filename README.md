# Investigating-the-Effectiveness-of-Machine-Learning-for-Targeted-Email-Marketing

This repository contains the code and report for a comparative study of machine learning procedures performed on the provided dataset. The goal is to predict whether an email led to a sale using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset is available in the file `CE802 Ass Resit.csv`.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of historical data with 1000 examples, each containing 8 features for emails sent in the past and a binary label indicating whether the receiver bought a product using the corresponding unique promotion code.

## Machine Learning Procedures

The following machine learning procedures were investigated:

1. Naive Bayes Classifier
2. Decision Trees
3. Two additional machine learning techniques (to be specified)

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `CE802 Ass Resit.csv` is the data set used
- `CE802_Assignment_2022-23_reassessment.pdf` is the assignment description
- `Comparative Study_ investigate the performance of a number of machine learning procedures.ipynb` is the Jupyter notebook used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `COMPARATIVE_STUDY-2202026.pdf` is the report summarizing the study results.
- `Pilot-Study Proposal.pdf` is the detailed proposal for this pilot study.
